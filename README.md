# Prison_Database
This repository contains the project prepared for the database course.

The goal of the project was to design a simple database for a prison. The project consisted of two parts. In the first one, my task was to model the database and create an ERD diagram. The second part of the task was the implementation of the database in Microsoft Server SQL and the implementation of business queries.
